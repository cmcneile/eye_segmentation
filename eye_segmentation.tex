\section{Introduction}

%%  https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html
The eyes and lenses were segmentated from the MRI scans
using the 3D slicer software~\cite{kikinis20133d}.
The segmentation editor module~\cite{pinter2019polymorph}
in 3D slicer was used to manually
extract the eye and lenses.
The
files were then written to disk in STL format.
We want to automate this processs, so that the eyes are extracted from
the MRI scans using machine learning.


\section{Automating the segmentation}

We followed the example scripts written by
Mokhtari Mohammed El Amine that used segmentation to extract
livers from MRI scans. The python code was available
on github
\url{https://github.com/amine0110/Liver-Segmentation-Using-Monai-and-PyTorch}. There
is long YouTube video about the application
\url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU4KlXKKnac}.

The example python script was built on the following libraries:

\begin{description}

  \item[monai] is a set of open-source, freely available collaborative frameworks built for accelerating research and clinical collaboration in Medical Imaging.  \url{https://monai.io/}

\item[pytorch] Pytorch~\cite{paszke2019pytorch}
  is an open source machine learning library  (\url{https://pytorch.org/}.)
    
\end{description}

The underlying deep network for segmentation was
U-net~\cite{ronneberger2015u}. 
This uses many layers of Convolutional neural networks.
It is a standard network architecture for many segmentation.
and was designed to be used with a small number of labelled images.

There are a variety of ways to compare the reconstructed
images (see the review~\cite{taha2015metrics} ).
The metric used is the Dice one~\cite{zijdenbos1994morphometric}.
